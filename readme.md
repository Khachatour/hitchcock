Hitchcock is similar to [simple-cache-provider](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/simple-cache-provider) with two extras:

* a render-props API
* a "suspense" debugger

## 🚨 EXPERIMENTAL 🚨

First: this depends on alpha versions of react and react-dom and uses very unstable APIs. Second: I have no idea what I'm doing.

## To do

* [x] Push something
* [ ] Write readme
* [ ] Examples
* [ ] Compat with simple-cache-provider
* [ ] Production build without deps
* [ ] Update to-do list
